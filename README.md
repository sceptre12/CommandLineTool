# CommandLineTool


The purpose for this tool will be for me to learn Go and to automate some of the tasks that I normally do on my computer. <br/>

I'm always creating and starting projects on my laptop. I should have a set place where my projects of specific types are created. 
I'd also like to make sure that my projects are stored in repos on either bitbucket or on github.

TODO redo all of the flag set to using the mow.cli <br/>
TODO use closer to create exit commands https://github.com/xlab/closer <br/>

Nice to haves: <br/>
Search for certain projects and open them in VsCode or the IDE that works best for that project. <br/>
Integrate a speech to text library into this so I can speak commands that execute the functions in this library
